## Identifying the optimal rapid antigen test for screening and determining the end of isolation: a modeling study

# Viral clearance model

'mpox.csv' is an example data of longitudinal viral load data for mpox patients.

'model.txt' is the description for mathematical model of viral clearance.

These files are used to estimate parameters of the viral clearance model in MONOLIX2023R1.


# Simulation for isolation rules

This code simulates and evaluates the effectiveness of various isolation rules for mpox patients: symptom-based, fixed-duration, and testing-based rules. Specifically, it calculates numerical values of the following metrics for ending isolation:
  1) Risk of prematurely ending isolation (%)
  2) Infectious period after ending isolation (days)
  3) Unnecessarily prolonged isolation period (days)

'populationParameters_mpox.txt' is an example for the estimated parameters of viral clearance model for mpox patients.

'Symptom-based.R' calculates numerical values of "Risk of prematurely ending isolation", "Infectious period after ending isolation", and "Unnecessarily prolonged isolation period" for mpox patients under symptom-based isolation rules.

'Fixed-duration.R' calculates numerical values of "Risk of prematurely ending isolation", "Infectious period after ending isolation", and "Unnecessarily prolonged isolation period" for mpox patients under fixed-duration isolation rules.

'Testing-based.R' calculates numerical values of "Risk of prematurely ending isolation", "Infectious period after ending isolation", and "Unnecessarily prolonged isolation period" for mpox patients under testing-based isolation rules.
